Command | Explanation
--- | ---
`psql` (set_pg) | This command is used to start the PostgreSQL command-line interface, allowing you to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
`\l` | This command is used within the psql interface to list all available databases.
`CREATE DATABASE chinook;` | This SQL command creates a new database named "chinook".
`\c chinook` or `psql -d chinook` | These commands are used to connect to the "chinook" database within the psql interface.
`\i Chinook_PostgreSql.sql` | This command is used within the psql interface to execute SQL commands from the file "Chinook_PostgreSql.sql", which can be used to create tables and populate data.
`\dt` | This command is used within the psql interface to list all tables in the current database.
`SELECT * FROM "Artist" WHERE "Name" = 'Queen';` | This SQL command selects all columns from the "Artist" table where the "Name" column is equal to 'Queen'.
`SELECT "Name" FROM "Artist";` | This SQL command selects only the "Name" column from the "Artist" table.
`SELECT * FROM "Artist" WHERE "ArtistId" = 51;` | This SQL command selects all columns from the "Artist" table where the "ArtistId" column is equal to 51.
`SELECT * FROM "Album" WHERE "ArtistId" = 51;` | This SQL command selects all columns from the "Album" table where the "ArtistId" column is equal to 51.
`\o test.json` | This command within the psql interface directs the output of subsequent queries to the file "test.json" in JSON format.
`SELECT json_agg(t) FROM (SELECT * FROM "Track" WHERE "Composer" = 'Queen') t;` | This SQL command selects all columns from the "Track" table where the "Composer" column is equal to 'Queen', and then aggregates the results into a JSON array.
`\copy (SELECT * FROM "Track" WHERE "Composer" = 'Queen') TO 'test.csv' WITH CSV DELIMITER ',' HEADER;` | This command within the psql interface exports the result of the query to a CSV file named "test.csv" with a comma as the delimiter and including a header row.
```

As for Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets, they are popular spreadsheet applications that can be used to open and manipulate CSV files like "test.csv" generated from the psql commands. You can import the CSV file into any of these applications to view and work with the data in a tabular format.
